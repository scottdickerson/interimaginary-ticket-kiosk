# Getting Started with the Ticket Kiosk

The ticket kiosk is a React-based app that connects to a local node server API that can interface with an Arduino board and ticket printer to print a ticket.

Testing locally
Start the UI server in development mode with `yarn start`
Start the Ticket printing API with `node server.js`

The email address is set from a local environment variable file called `TICKET_EMAIL`. Change the value in the `.env` file to change it.
If you want to disable the Ticket printing screen set the `TICKET_PRINTER` variable to false

## Running in your local docker

`docker build -t interimaginary:kiosk .`
`docker run -p 3000:80 interimaginary:kiosk`

Opening the locally hosted URL on Docker
<http://localhost>

## Deploying to heroku (deploys the static app not the container)

`heroku login`
`git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/limitless-forest-56616.git`
`git push heroku main`
`heroku open`

To view the app directly:
<https://limitless-forest-56616.herokuapp.com/>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
